## Dependencies

Scripts build primarily on functions from the R packages `prospectr`, `caret` and `tidyverse`. Some analysis scripts are designed to run in parallel on a cluster, but can be easily serialized. Long computation times should be expected in this case. 

## Content  

Folder `Utils` contains functions for the pre-processing of spectra, calculation and evaluation of spectral indices, training and evaluation of full-spectrum models, recursive feature elimination and analysis of variance. 

Folder `Analysis`contains scripts to implement the analysis and obtain results contained in the study. 

### Utils

#### 001_spectra_utils.R

1. `f_spc_smooth` applies the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter to raw spectra (wrapper for `prospectr::SavitzkyGolay`)
2. `f_spc_avg` averages replicate measurements
3. `f_calc_si`calculates spectral indices
4. `f_scale_si` scales spectral indices and predictions obtained from full-spectrum model to range from 0 to 10
5. `f_spc_bin` computes average values of a signal in pre-determined bins (wrapper for `prospectr::binning`)
6. `f_spc_trim` removes noisy parts of the signal in pre-determined ranges
7. Several data wrangling helper functions. 

#### 002_pls_utils.R

1. `f_splsda` fits PLS-DA and S-PLS-DA models for classification into healthy and disease canopies. This is essentially a wrapper for functions of the `mixOmics` package. 
2. `assess_mod_perf` evaluates model performance on the main experiment.
3. `assess_mod_perf2` evaluates model performance on FPWW023 (used to quantify model robustness over time). 

#### 003_dynpars_utils.R

1. `get_dyn_pars` extracts dynamics parameters and plots model fits for each plot and spectral index. This function by default fits a Gompertz model with asymptotes constrained to 0 and 10. This is a wrapper for `nls_multstart::nls_multstart`.
2. `get_dyn_pars_lin` extracts dnyamics parameters for each plot and spectral index using linear interpolation. This function should be used if the temporal resolution of spectral measurements does not allow to fit parametric models. 
3. Various helper functions called by 1. and 2. 

#### 004_plot_predobs.R

1. `assess_mod_perf` extracts various model performance metrics.
2. `plot_predobs` creates predicted vs. observed plots. 
3. Helper functions. 

#### 005_rfe_utils.R
1. `perform_rfe` performs recursive feature elimination.
2. `tidy_rfe_output` gathers results of resamples.
3. `plot_perf_profile` creates a performance profile plot based on the tidy output of `perform_rfe`. 
4. Helper functions

### Analysis

1. `01_prep_spcdat.R` Prepare spectral datasets for subquent analysis: (1) spectral index datasets, (2) spectral datasets for calibration and validation of (S)PLS-DA models. 
2. `02_pls_class.R` Fit (S)PLS-DA models, extract variable importance, assess "internal", "general" and "dynamic" model performance. 
3. `03_extract_dynpars.R` Fit Gompertz model (optionally different models) and linear interpolation to spectral indices, extract model and dynamics parameters. 
4. `04_subset_selection.R` Select subsets of sensitive and insensitive spectral indices.
5. `05_generate_preds.R` Extract spectral-temporal features. 
6. `06_class_spctemp.R` Fit and evaluate classification models (healthy, non-inoculated plots vs. disease, inoculated plots) based on spectral-temporal features. 
7. `07_class_spctemp_rfe.R` Perform recursive feature elimination for classification models. 
8. `08_regr_spctemp.R` Fit and evaluate regression models to predict disease severity based on spectral-temporal features.
9. `09_regr_rflt.R` Fit and evaluate regression models to predict disease severity based on spectral reflectance at t3. 
10. `10_regr_spctemp_rfe.R` Perform recursive feature elimination for regression models. 
11. `11_feat_validation.R` Validation of the most predictive feature(s) on a test dataset from 2016.
